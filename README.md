# My Playground

This is my playground project where I experiment and practice frontend skills. I use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Framer Motion** for animations and transitions. By building cool components and designs here, I hope to improve my frontend development skills.

> **Note:**  
> I am **not focusing** on responsive design, just want to practice for the dekstop view as of now.
